- 👋 Hi, I’m @LioraFarkovitz and I'm already a Dapp Addict. I love this.
- 👀 I’m interested in DAPP University Training and installing my framework quickly today, but generally AWS and Ethereum.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the components, do I need to install dependencies in a particular order? It's not working like the videos.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NFT publishing for forensic purposes (LoveBytes.Digital) and also artistic purposes (ContentDrivenUSA). I want to do an ico first, and then attach it to my various networks to support my overall development efforts.
- 📫 How to reach me ...I could be better about this... but I guess my full name at gmail. I intend to hire through upwork for my own nft publishing tweaks, and I need an adoble expert first. I need something done in a one day turn around if that is feasible/reasonable anymore. I need pre-registered/approved turks for future hits.
